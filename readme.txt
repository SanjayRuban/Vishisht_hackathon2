PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Integrate a freelancing platform with online education to provide hands-on experience and financial appreciation,
addressing the lack of structured, self-paced learning and learner engagement.

Detailed view:-
Low student engagement, ineffective assessments, and inadequate support systems in online education lead to suboptimal learning outcomes.

Students often feel isolated, have limited interaction with peers and instructors, and lack immediate feedback and accountability.

Ineffective assessment methods fail to accurately gauge students' understanding, progress, and mastery.

Many online platforms lack comprehensive support systems, leaving students without sufficient guidance or personalized assistance.

Addressing these issues is crucial for improving learning outcomes and ensuring the viability of online education as an alternative to traditional learning.
